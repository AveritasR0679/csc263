## CSC263 - Data Structures & Analysis

Data structures are ways of organizing the data involved in computation, suitable for representation in and manipulation by computers. Algorithms are precisely stated, general problem solving methods. Data structures and algorithms are central to computer science. They are also integrally related: neither can be studied fruitfully without knowledge of the other. 

This course has two goals:

1.	learn several important data structures and algorithms, including how to choose and/or modify a data structure to solve various problems

2.	introduce the basic tools and techniques for the analysis of algorithms and data structures

### Materials

_Required Textbook_: Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein; MIT press and McGraw-Hill, 2009.

Additional course readings (of which there are several) are posted on the course website, and will be included in the /extras folder.

### Lectures

Classes are held M/W/F for one hour. Lecture notes are made contemporaneously, then reviewed and transcribed in the days following the lecture.

### Assessments

There are 6 assignments due on a roughly bi-weekly basis. My solutions will not be posted until after they have been graded & returned, to uphold academic integrity.

There is one midterm, and one final.
